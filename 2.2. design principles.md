## encapsulation
- private instance variables and public methods to get and set them.
- only the class, itself, has access to fields.
```java
class Person{
	private int id;
	private String name;
	
	public Person(int id, String name) {
		if(id >= 0 && name != null) {
			this.id = id;
			this.name = name;
		}
		else {
			throw new IllegalArgumentException();
		}
	}
	
	public int getId() {
		return id;
	}
	public void setId(int id) {
		this.id = id;
	}
	public String getName() {
		return name;
	}
	public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}
}
```

### javabean convention
- fields are private
- if field is not boolean getVarName & setVarName
- if it is boolean (primitive), Ä±t may be isVarName for getter
- Boolean is object. It must not be isVarName.

### is-a relationship
- instanceof

### has-a relationship
- to have sth
- Car class has tires. A tire has size color and type.
- Audi extends Car class. Therefore, Audi has tires too. (tires are not private)

### object composition

## design patterns

### singleton
- private constructor -> making final
- getInstance
```java
class One {
	private static final One instance = new One();
	
	private One() {}
	
	public static One getInstance() {
		return instance;
	}
}

class Two {
	private static final Two instance;
	static{
		instance = new Two();
	}
	
	private Two() {}
	
	public static Two getInstance() {
		return instance;
	}
}
```

### lazy instantiation
create when it is needed.
```java
class Three {
	private static Three instance;
	
	private Three() {}
	
	public static Three getInstance() {
		if(instance == null)
			instance = new Three();
		return instance;
	}
}
```
it is bad for multithread
```java
public static synchronized Three getInstance() {
```
better than this
```java
class Four {
	private static Four instance;
	
	private Four() {}
	
	public static Four getInstance() {
		if(instance == null) {
			synchronized(Four.class) {
				if(instance == null) {
					instance = new Four();
				}
			}
		}
		return instance;
	}
}
```
### immutable objects
