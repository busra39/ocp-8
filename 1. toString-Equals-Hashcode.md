# toString
When print method is called with an object, the toString() is being called implicitly.
ArrayList hav its own toString() - meaaning output.
If toString isn't overridden, the output will not be human readable.

# equals
To check givens object's equality.
String overrides equals however StringBuilder does not. 
Or Any other custom classes should override equals method, if the equals is required to be perfomed correctly.
```java
class OverriddedEquality {
	int n;
	public OverriddedEquality (int n) {
		this.n= n;
	}
	@Override
	public boolean equals(Object obj) {
		if(!(obj instanceof OverriddedEquality))
			return false;
		OverriddedEquality tmp = (OverriddedEquality) obj;
		return tmp.n == this.n;
	}	
}
```

```java
StringBuilder sb1 = new StringBuilder("aa");
StringBuilder sb2 = new StringBuilder("aa");
System.out.println(sb1.equals(sb2)); // false - StringBuilder does not override equals, uses Object's
		
OverriddedEquality overriddedEquality =  new OverriddedEquality(1);
OverriddedEquality overriddedEquality2 =  new OverriddedEquality(1);
System.out.println(overriddedEquality.equals(overriddedEquality2)); // true;
```

Following example could not be compiled because equals method of Object class is not being overriden.
```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Lion obj) -> DOES NOT COMPILE
```

# HashCode
Must not be changed during the program
```java
@Override
public int hashCode() {
    return n + 7;
}
```
